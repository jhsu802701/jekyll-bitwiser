# Generic Jekyll Site With Bitwiser

This is a generic Jekyll Site that uses the [Bitwiser](https://github.com/brijeshb42/bitwiser) theme.  This site is designed for easy deployment to Heroku.

This site is created by a script that downloads the [Bitwiser](https://github.com/brijeshb42/bitwiser) source code and then adds the scripts I created at (https://github.com/jhsu802701/jekyll-bitwiser)[https://github.com/jhsu802701/jekyll-bitwiser] to streamline the process of deploying to [Distelli](https://www.distelli.com/) or [BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com).

## What's wrong with deploying to GitHub?
* It supports only the minima theme.  If you want to use any other theme, you're out of luck.
* The _site directory has to be saved in the source code.

## What's wrong with deploying to Heroku?
* It's a convoluted and unreliable process.
* Heroku does not officially support Jekyll.

## Why are Distelli and BitBalloon better?
* Both officially support Jekyll.
* The procedures are easy and straightforward.
* Free accounts are available.
